Change Log:

2.0:
	Complete rewrite.
	Full support for all formats when using animated textures like video.
	New "Stereoscopic 3D Image" asset system to better pre-configure media for display.
	Easier streamlined setup.
	Support for Unity 5.6 VideoPlayer.
	Improved Stereoscopic 3D Screenshot script.
	Reorganized file hierarchy.
	Replaced the old "Example Image" with 7 real Stereoscopic 3D images.

2.01:	
	Added a Vive SDK check to the camera setup script, and resulting adjustments to the setup procedure.
	Exposed the currentImage variable to public read access.	
	The ImageFormat variable is now read only. Use SetFormat() to change the format via script.
	Addressed an issue with several Methods not expecting a scenerio where no Stereoscopic 3D image is being displayed.
	Fixed the issue where you couldn't access public Methods and Variables before the Start() method had processed, without causing errors.
	Fixed an issue with changing the format of an active video via SetFormat() causing the video to restart from the begining.

2.1:
	Improved the camera setup procedure with a, hopefully, easier to understand button. The old right click menu is still available though.
	Added support for using the UI.RawImage component as a canvas to display 3D media.
	Added a new high poly count 360 canvas. It's now used in the demo scene. The old low poly version is still available though.
	Misc bug fixes.

2.2:
	Converted the ReadMe to a Manual.
	Fixed some position/rotation issues with the Stereoscopic3DScreenshot script.
	Added new demo content/scene to show how to use the Stereoscopic3DScreenshot script to allow players to make use of it at runtime/gametime.

2.3:
	Added new Panoramic shader based canvas formats.
	Added wrapModeOverride option to Stereoscopic3dImage objects. This is mostly for video clip textures that don't expose the WrapMode property in the Import Settings.
	Added ConvergenceMode option.
	Fixed a rotation bug with the Example3DScreenshotController.
	Reorganized the Demo Scenes folder hierarchy.
	Tuned up the Stereoscopic3DImage object inspector.
	Tweaked the AnaglyphToSBSTexture() method to support more than just Red/Cyan now.
	The camera setup notification box will now not display on the example cross-eyed camra rigs.
	Added scenes/canvas meshes for 180 Panoramic display.
